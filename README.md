# OpenCli

My own little experiments with the new OpenCli Specification (OCS) concept.

I'm currently manually recreating the Document Model from the OpenCli specification, and experimenting with the 
[CommandLineParser](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline) library, to generate an OpenCli specification document from a .NET assembly that uses CommandLineParser.
